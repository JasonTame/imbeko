                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Imbeko website, located at www.Imbeko.org, any mobile applications, and services (“Site”) provided by Imbeko (Pty) Ltd (“Imbeko”).

If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Site.</p>
                    <p>To the extent that anything in or associated with the Site is in conflict or inconsistent with these Terms, the Terms shall control. Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under the Terms will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation of non-enforcement. If any provision of the Terms is held invalid by any law or regulation of any government, or by any court or arbitrator, the parties agree that such provision will be replaced with a new provision that accomplishes the original business purpose, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

In making hiring decisions, Students should review and investigate each Tutor's self-reported credentials, education, and experience, as well as reviews from other Students. All tutoring sessions should be supervised by a responsible adult.</p>

                    <h3>Copyright and use of material</h3>

                  </div>
                  <div class="tab-pane" id="tab2">
                    <p>By registering on the Imbeko website (the “Site”) as a tutor with Imbeko, you (“Tutor”) agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Site (the “Terms”), and those Terms as well as these Tutor terms shall govern your obligations and the payments made to you by Students through the Site.</p>
                    <h3>Appointment</h3>
                    <p>Upon acceptance of the Tutor by Imbeko, Imbeko agrees to list the Tutor, on the Site, as a provider of tutored lessons to students (“Students”).</p>
                    <h3>Nature of appointment</h3>
                    <p>The Tutor expressly acknowledges that he/she is an independent contractor, and is not an employee of Imbeko. Nothing in these terms shall be deemed to constitute or imply any partnership, joint venture, employment or fiduciary relationship between the Tutor and Imbeko.</p>
                    <h3>No guarantee of tutoring projects</h3>
                    <p>The listing of a Tutor on the Site does not guarantee that the Tutor will receive any tutoring lessons, and the Tutor agrees that he/she may not make any claim or demand upon Imbeko for the provision of tutoring projects. In particular, the Tutor acknowledges that, among other factors, Student discretion dictates which Tutor is finally chosen to render their services to a Student.</p>
                    <h3>Conditions for guaranteeing receipt of payment for student lessons</h3>
                    <p>Imbeko is a marketplace for those seeking tutoring services in an African language to connect with those seeking to provide tutoring services. Imbeko also provides a service to its users whereby payments will be distributed to tutors that originate from their students. Imbeko offers tutors a layer of protection in the collection of their funds but, if any of the following conditions are not met and Imbeko is unable to collect your payment from the Student to whom you gave a lesson, Imbeko cannot guarantee that your payment will be successfully collected, processed and distributed to you:</p>
                    <ol type = "a">
                        <li>The information pertaining to the lesson is accurate. This includes the agreed start and end time, duration and subject. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Tutor and Student, the start and end time will be considered to be the times of the actual tutoring lesson, not arrival and departure times to and from the tutoring location.</li>
                        <li>Prior to each lesson being given, the Student has on file with Imbeko valid payment details.</li>
                        <li>The lesson has been delivered in-person at a mutually agreed upon location.</li>
                        <li>The Tutor has conducted him- or herself in accordance with good tutoring practice.</li>
                        <li>The Tutor enters the lesson into the Imbeko system or assesses a cancellation fee within seven (7) days of the lesson occurring. Payment for lessons entered outside of this window cannot be distributed until the lessons are approved by the student. Lessons cannot be submitted more than thirty-one (31) days after the date of the lesson.</li>
                        <li>The Tutor does not collect or request payment directly from the Student by cash or otherwise, for the lesson.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Release of payment</h3>
                    <p>In return for the Tutor's acceptable performance in providing tutored lessons, in accordance with this agreement and the Terms, Imbeko shall release a Student’s payment to the Tutor at 75% of the lesson rate advertised and agreed to at the outset of each tutoring project. </p>
                    <p>Rates for tutored lessons to be provided by the Tutor may vary between tutoring projects and are all-inclusive; any costs required to be incurred in providing the tutored lesson (including transport) are to be borne by the Tutor. </p>
                    <p>The remaining 25% of the money due for each lesson will be paid in bulk to the tutor at the completion of the 15-week course.</p>
                    <p>You may be partnered with a second tutor for the first 1-3 weeks until Imbeko are comfortable that you are ready to take classes on your own. In this case, you will receive 50% of the income for these weeks, and so will your fellow tutor. This is a form of on-the-job training.</p>
                    <h3>Service Fee</h3>
                    <ol type = "a">
                        <li>The Tutor agrees that in exchange for Imbeko’s services, Imbeko and its partners shall charge the Tutor a service fee, which shall be inclusive of VAT, which commission will be deducted from any monies received and held by Imbeko from Students in respect of tutored lessons conducted by the Tutor, prior to release of earned fees to the Tutor.</li>
                        <li>The percentage of service fee charged per tutored lesson may vary from one project to the next, depending on the number of lessons purchased by a Student.</li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>Imbeko’s service fee structure is as follows:</p>

                    <h4>Lesson selection process</h4>
                    <p>If a student decides to submit their name onto the site through the request a tutor application, the tutor will only see the student’s name, suburb and tutoring request. The student’s contact details are only conveyed to the tutor once the tutor has accepted the student’s request.</p>
                    <h4>Post first Tutor-Student lesson:</h4>
                    <p>Imbeko will contact the student and tutor to ensure the lesson was relevant and met the standards expected.</p>
                    <p>Imbeko will request the student to provide a review of the tutor to assist future students wanting to use the tutor.</p>
                    <p>If a student is unhappy with a tutor, or vice versa, Imbeko will endeavour to replace the tutor, failing which future lessons will be cancelled and, where appropriate, a refund provided.</p>

                    <h3>Keeping our tutors safe</h3>
                    <p>Whilst a tutor’s acceptance or rejection of a tutoring job is under the control of the tutor, Imbeko has taken various steps to ensure that a student is trustworthy and a tutor is safe.</p>

                    <h4>Meet in public</h4>
                    <p>Always tell someone in your family or a friend where you are going and when you will return. Always provide your own transportation to and from your lesson. For individual sessions, meet in a public place with many people around such as a library or coffee shop.</p>
                    <h4>Keep personal information private</h4>
                    <p>Never include your last name, home address, phone number, place of work, or any other identifying information in initial e-mail messages or communications.
